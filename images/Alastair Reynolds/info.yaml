    Description: Lighthuggers are a class of ships in Revelation Space. They are so named because their conjoiner drives, mysterious zero-point energy black boxes containing a heavily-modified human brain performing just-in-time quantum mechanical calculations, allow them to reach relativistic speeds. They are variously armed for both battle and impactor defense, and further protected by  ablative shields of ice.
