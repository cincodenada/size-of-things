  Description: Unicron's builder is not described in the film. The size quoted above
    is based on pure extrapolation from the film, and is probably generous. I have
    seen sizes quoted anywhere from 3000km to "the size of a large planet", however
    the cartoon is extremely liberal with respect to scale and consistency. The Transformers
    seem to inhabit large asteroids rather than planets, which would mean that a large
    planet from their point of view may in fact be a large asteroid (Ceres is one
    of the largest known asteroids in our solar system and measures approximately
    1000km in diameter, which is why I chose that size).
  Diameter: 1000.0
