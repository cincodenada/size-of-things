  Description: ''
  Name: 'This completely realistic, original, and scientifically plausible alien represents
    all the multitudinous Science Fiction aliens who are miracles of convergent evolution
    to the point where they are all pretty much exactly like humans with bumpy heads
    : Vulcans (Star Trek) Cardassians (Star Trek) Bajorans (Star Trek) Ferengi (Star
    Trek) Andorians (Star Trek) Klingons (Star Trek) Romulans (Star Trek) Zabrak (Darth
    Maul, Star Wars) Sand People (Star Wars) Klatooians (Star Wars) Twi''lek (Star
    Wars) Minbari (B5) Star Man (Star Man) Alien Nation Aliens My-ik and Du-Ug (Evil
    Alien Conquerors. Actually they were pretty funny.) Dr.Lazarus (Galaxy Quest.
    Ok, I''m just being ironic here, Dr. Lazarus is making a point of being a guy
    with rubber bumps on his head) The list goes on and on..... And the Winner: The
    alien at the end of "Contact". I sat here 3 hours for this??? (No I''m just kidding.
    Everyone should read "Contact", then see the movie. Carl Sagan was a genius, and
    is one of the inspirations for this website. Per his example, we strive to get
    people to love science fiction, so that they feel inspired enough to try to bridge
    the gap between Science Fiction and Science Fact.) Go here for a good explanation
    of Star Trek''s rationalization for many rubber-bump-head people.'
